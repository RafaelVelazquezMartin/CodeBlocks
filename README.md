# CodeBlocks

Javascript w/ Socket.io multiplayer game that allows children to learn about the execution flow of a program by allowing them to 'program' the movements of different objects with a canvas to form a desired shape.


## How it works
1. One player **'The Programmer'** is given a prompt of the shape to be formed. 
2. **'The Programmer'** sets the intructions for forming the shape without seing the result. 
3. After being happy with the tasks he has scheduled, **'The Programmer'** "runs" the program.
4. The objects in the canvas, sequentially perfom the intructions provided by **'The Programmer'**.
5. The other players **'The Guessers'** are then prompted to guess what shape the other player was attempting to form.


This game was developed as a challenge made by J.P. Morgan at the 48hr [GUTS 2018 Hackathon](https://gutechsoc.com/hackathon), with the collaboration of [Martin Vrabec](https://github.com/martinvrabec).
